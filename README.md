## Rule of thumb
- Every `private` property should have `get`/`set`
- No more than 10-15 lines per function

## Step 1 - Read
Write the classes `Driver`, `Car` and `Ride`.
use index.php to check if they work.

## Step 2 - Create
Use file as Database and every line in the file represent JSON string of `Ride` Object.
